Description: The package implements a hierarchical Dirichlet mixture of Dirichlet distributions.
    It can be used to reduce the dimensionality of hierarchical data, cluster individuals or decompose 
    probability tensors. The model is based on a paper by Dunson and Xing (2009), but instead of a Dirichlet 
    Process mixture of Dirichlet distributions a finite dimensional approximation is made.
