Version: 0.1.0

Description: The package implements a hierarchical Dirichlet mixture of Dirichlet distributions.
    It can be used to reduce the dimensionality of hierarchical data, cluster individuals or decompose 
    probability tensors. The model is based on a paper by Dunson and Xing (2009), but implements a scalable
    variational inference algorithm so that it is applicable to large datasets.
